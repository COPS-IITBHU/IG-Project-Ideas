### Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Setup
<img src="media/irl_marl.png" align="right" height="300"/>

**Objective**<br/>
*The main idea of the problem statement is to design a Reward for chaotic system such as a MultiAgent Comparative setup, Where individual agent may not contribute to a final reward and will not promote many trivial behaviors which we come to expect. The main objective of the project is to formulate a IRL algorithm which seemless workes across variables like number of agents, role of each agent and horizon of the problem. The emphasize will not be on the Complexity of the algorithm but rather on the Concept of Distributed MultiAgent Reward Learning*

**Setup**<br/>
A simple ant hill is the simplest of multiagent system with surplus amount of Teacher Data readily available for us to use. A simple 2D enviroment can be used for testing out the algorithm and simple location trackers can be deployed on the available video data to get the neccesary data. The main problem to address would be to representating the observation of the data for IRL.
